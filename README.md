==================

Final Project ideas/plans/build 

I'd like to build a pedal type thing that would take audio and make visualizations that would interface with a projector.  I'd like to use stereo audio from a board mix.  Ideally, I'd like to use a 1/4" plug from a guitar or keyboard.

I have to figuire out how to capture the frequencies, assign a color to a frequency range and randomized shapes.  I'd like to fade between the colors  and blend them.  I'd like the fade to be tied to the tempo of the music.  Also, I'd like to have the color intensity be tied to the relative loudness of audio being sent through.
